Standardization
---------------
[ ] Default objective functions should be minimizing functions.

Code reuse
----------
[ ] Alter inheritance structure of MOGS, MOGM, PAFD, PAU such that they inherit
    from a class with wcoeff and tfreq.

Performance Improvements
------------------------
[ ] For bare bones objfn_mat and objfn_vec_mat functions, maybe force use of
    only precomputed values (e.g. wcoeff must be already calculated)? This
    would reduce flexibility in the accessible static method, but may slightly
    improve performance by eliminating if statements.

Feature Additions
-----------------
[ ] calc_D in Population class.
[ ] calc_D_prime in Population class.
[ ] calc_r in Population class.
[ ] logger functionality like what Scott uses
[ ] add MarkerEffect class/file import
[ ] convert 'from_vcf', 'from_egmap', etc. to @classmethod that accept cls
    instead of self as arguments... maybe if not too many bugs are caused.

Testing
-------
[ ] Unit testing for everything.
[ ] Unit testing for Population
    [ ] Unit testing for 'from_vcf'
    [ ] Unit testing for constructor
