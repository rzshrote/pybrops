Standardization
---------------
[ ] Default objective functions should be minimizing functions.
[✓] Figure out code packaging stuff. What a beast!

Code reuse
----------
[ ] Alter inheritance structure of MOGS, MOGM, PAFD, PAU such that they inherit
    from a class with wcoeff and tfreq.
[ ] Make AbstractSortable class for lexsort, reorder, sort?

Performance Improvements
------------------------
[ ] For bare bones objfn_mat and objfn_vec_mat functions, maybe force use of
    only precomputed values (e.g. wcoeff must be already calculated)? This
    would reduce flexibility in the accessible static method, but may slightly
    improve performance by eliminating if statements.
[ ] improve vcf load speeds if possible

Known bugs (✓ = fixed)
----------------------
[✓] mkr_mask and similar functions have tuples where assignments are made.
    These tuples need to be converted to lists since tuples are immutable.
[ ] SSD simulations are wrong; original calculations used recombination
    probabilities observed across entire population at selfing generation s.
    These probabilities are across and infinite number of progeny, but for
    finite sample sizes, the probability of where recombination points land with
    respect to each other is dependent on previous recombination events.
    Ultra critical to fix this error.

Feature Additions
-----------------
Population
    [✓] move constructor checking for geno to object properties
    [✓] move set_marker_set to object properties
    [✓] move set_genomic_model to object properties
    [✓] move set_taxa to object properties
    [ ] calc_D in Population class.
    [ ] calc_D_prime in Population class.
    [ ] calc_r in Population class.
    [ ] convert 'from_vcf', 'from_egmap', etc. to @classmethod that accept cls
        instead of self as arguments... maybe if not too many bugs are caused.
    [ ] Population: expand mkr_rename, taxa_rename to have rename at specific locations
    [ ] Population: auto_sort for taxa
    [ ] Population: hapmap import
    [ ] Population: genetic distance metrics
        [ ] Euclidean distances
        [ ] AMOVA distances
        [ ] Bray-Curtis individual distance
        [ ] Czekanowski (Manhattan) distance
        [ ] Rogers (Euclidean) distance
        [ ] Nei's genetic distance
Cross
    [ ] Cross: auto detect progeny variance from simulations or matrix math
    [ ] Sparse matrices!
    [ ] Non-homozygous progeny variance calculations.
MarkerSet
    [ ] move constructor checking to object properties
    [ ] chr_grp error checking in property
    [ ] chr_start error checking in property
    [ ] chr_stop error checking in property
    [ ] mkr_name error checking in property
    [ ] physical_dist: FIXME
    [✓] mkr_mask: modify chr_start and chr_stop arguments to interpret as ranges
    [ ] mkr_index: make this so that indices are matched with the arguments?
    [ ] has: work on this since chr_start could be on multiple chromosomes
    [ ] MarkerSet: remove specific indices
    [ ] MarkerSet: expand mkr_rename to have rename at specific locations
GeneticMap
    [✓] GeneticMap: do not require sorted internals to build spline
    [ ] GeneticMap: remove map_fncode because it's a pain to maintain;
        it would be better to just store as single variable.
Algorithm module
    [ ] Integrate DEAP with package
Program module
    [ ] Establish common BreedingProgram class with set API.
    [ ] HDF5 support for exporting matrices, etc.
Miscellaneous Features
    [ ] add abstract citation method to Breeding class.
    [ ] logger functionality like what Scott uses
    [ ] add MarkerEffect class/file import
    [ ] mem accept strings of memory sizes as inputs
    [ ] Maybe have mkr base class for handling mkr related things?
    [ ] Copy methods for objects.
    [✓] get functools working (3rd party package compile issue)
        [✓] remove temporary loop fix
    [ ] object print/head statements
    [ ] breed module: migrate simulate functions to new BreedingProgram class?
