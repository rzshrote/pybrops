Standardization
---------------
[ ] Default objective functions should be minimizing functions.
[✓] Figure out code packaging stuff. What a beast!

Code reuse
----------
[ ] Alter inheritance structure of MOGS, MOGM, PAFD, PAU such that they inherit
    from a class with wcoeff and tfreq.

Performance Improvements
------------------------
[ ] For bare bones objfn_mat and objfn_vec_mat functions, maybe force use of
    only precomputed values (e.g. wcoeff must be already calculated)? This
    would reduce flexibility in the accessible static method, but may slightly
    improve performance by eliminating if statements.
[ ] improve vcf load speeds

Feature Additions
-----------------
[ ] calc_D in Population class.
[ ] calc_D_prime in Population class.
[ ] calc_r in Population class.
[ ] logger functionality like what Scott uses
[ ] add MarkerEffect class/file import
[ ] convert 'from_vcf', 'from_egmap', etc. to @classmethod that accept cls
    instead of self as arguments... maybe if not too many bugs are caused.
[ ] mem accept strings of memory sizes as inputs
[✓] GeneticMap: do not require sorted internals to build spline
[ ] MarkerSet.mkr_index: make this so that indices are matched with the arguments?
[ ] MarkerSet.has: work on this since chr_start could be on multiple chromosomes
[ ] MarkerSet: remove specific indices
[ ] MarkerSet: expand mkr_rename to have rename at specific locations
[ ] Population: expand mkr_rename, taxa_rename to have rename at specific locations
[ ] Population: auto_sort for taxa
[ ] Maybe have mkr base class for handling mkr related things?
