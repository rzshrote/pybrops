Data Types in PyBrOpS
#####################

PyBrOpS is a large, comprehensive software package with many different data types. The goal of this section is to provide an brief overview of the essential data types in PyBrOpS and their purpose. PyBrOpS data types can be grouped into four general categories: those associated with population genetics, those associated with genomic modeling, those associated with optimization, and finally, those associated with breeding simulations.
