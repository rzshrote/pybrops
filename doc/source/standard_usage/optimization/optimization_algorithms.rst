Class Family Overview
=====================

All optimization algorithms, regardless of their nature, are represented by classes implementing the ``OptimizationAlgorithm`` interface. Since optimization algorithms are very diverse, the ``OptimizationAlgorithm`` interface only requires a single method to be implemented: the ``minimize`` method.
