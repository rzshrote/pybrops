Prerequisites
#############

Knowledge of the Python programming language is a prerequisite. For a refresher, see the `Python tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_.

PyBrOpS makes extensive use of NumPy arrays. For a refresher, see the `NumPy user guide <https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/index.html>`_. 

If you desire to create custom genetic algorithms, PyBrOpS relies on the `PyMOO <https://pymoo.org/>`_ package for its algorithm framework.
