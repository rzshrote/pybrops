Population Genetics Data Types
##############################

The ``pybrops.popgen`` module houses modules, classes, and functions related to population genetics, as the name suggests. Population genetics data types serve as the foundations for simulations.

Genetic Maps
************

Genetic maps are essential for breeding simulations since they are used to estimate marker-wise recombination probabilities in mating simulations. PyBrOpS provides functionality for the reading and writing of genetic maps and the interpolation of genetic map positions via ``GeneticMap`` objects.
