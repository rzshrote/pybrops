Introducing PyBrOpS: Powerful Stochastic Simulation and Optimization for Breeding Programs

PyBrOpS - Python Breeding Optimizer and Simulator - is a comprehensive Python package capable of performing stochastic simulations and associated single- and multi-objective optimizations for plant and animal breeding programs. PyBrOpS empowers researchers and breeders to explore breeding possibilities in-silico, allowing for researchers to study novel and established breeding methodologies and for breeders to make informed decisions, driving significant improvements in their programs.

One of the key strengths of PyBrOpS lies in its ability to perform both single and multi-objective optimizations, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of breeding applications. By leveraging this optimization functionality, breeders can uncover tradeoffs and gain valuable insights to guide their decision-making processes.

Although there are several extant packages with breeding program simulation capabilities, what sets PyBrOpS apart from other simulation softwares is its unique multi-objective optimization feature. This feature enables breeders to evaluate multiple objectives simultaneously, allowing them to explore the tradeoffs inherent in breeding programs. With PyBrOpS, breeders can visualize and understand the complex relationships between various objectives, leading to more informed and effective breeding strategies.

Built using the SOLID software architecture principles, PyBrOpS is a modular and extensible package. This architectural design ensures that the software is flexible and adaptable to meet the specific needs of researchers and breeders. PyBrOpS provides a framework for customization and expansion, allowing users to seamlessly integrate new functionalities or extend existing ones as their breeding programs evolve.

PyBrOpS adopts a script-based framework, offering breeders maximum flexibility in simulating their breeding programs. This approach allows users to specify and control various aspects of their simulations through easy-to-write scripts, enabling precise customization and fine-tuning. Whether it's defining breeding objectives, incorporating genetic models, or incorporating environmental factors, PyBrOpS provides breeders with the necessary tools to simulate their programs with remarkable accuracy.

With PyBrOpS, the world of breeding programs enters a new era of simulation and optimization. Its powerful stochastic simulation capabilities, multi-objective optimization functionality, SOLID software architecture principles, and script-based framework combine to create an indispensable tool for plant and animal breeders. PyBrOpS empowers breeders to make informed decisions, explore tradeoffs, and achieve remarkable advancements in their breeding programs.



AlphaSimR is a package for performing stochastic simulations of plant and animal breeding programs. It is the successor to the AlphaSim software for breeding program simulation (Faux et al. 2016). AlphaSimR combines the features of its predecessor with the R software environment to create a flexible and easy-to-use software environment capable of simulating very complex plant and animal breeding programs.

There is no single way to construct a simulation in AlphaSimR. This is an intentional design aspect of AlphaSimR, because it frees users from the constraints of predefined simulation structures. However, most simulations follow a general structure consisting of four steps:
