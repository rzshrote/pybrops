What is PyBrOpS?
================

PyBrOpS - Python Breeding Optimizer and Simulator - is a comprehensive Python package capable of performing stochastic simulations and associated single- and multi-objective optimizations for plant and animal breeding programs. PyBrOpS empowers researchers and breeders to explore breeding possibilities in-silico, allowing for researchers to study novel and established breeding methodologies and for breeders to make informed decisions, driving significant improvements in their programs.

Although there are several extant packages with breeding program simulation capabilities, what sets PyBrOpS apart from other simulation softwares is its ability to perform both single- and multi-objective optimizations, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of breeding applications. PyBrOpS's multi-objective features enable breeders to evaluate multiple objectives simultaneously, allowing them to visualize and explore complex tradeoffs inherent in breeding programs, leading to more informed and effective breeding strategies.

Built using the SOLID software architecture principles, PyBrOpS is a modular and extensible package. This architectural design ensures that the software is flexible and adaptable to meet the specific needs of researchers and breeders. PyBrOpS provides a framework for customization and expansion, allowing users to seamlessly integrate new functionalities or extend existing ones as their research goals or breeding programs evolve.

PyBrOpS adopts a script-based framework, offering breeders maximum flexibility in simulating their breeding programs. This approach allows users to specify and control various aspects of their simulations through easy-to-write scripts, enabling precise customization and fine-tuning.
